I currently work at [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/). In 2020, I'm focused on:

- Learning AWS and supplementing my knowledge with personal projects
- Growing to absolutely adore Docker, I spend as much time with it as I reasonably can
- Refining my Ruby/Rails expertise on a major structural refactor
- Creating in-house tooling to ease our dev team's passage and responsibility through a major refactor
- Seeking out and tackling potential slowdowns ahead of time
- Designing and implementing my own structures, from the top down
- Pushing to remove things from our monolith that do not need to be there
- Optimizing queries and working on a rake proxy between AWS and our public loadbalancer
- Performing a massive data migration of all of our customer accounts from on-prem hardware to AWS offerings.

I enjoy working on personal challenges, passion projects, and with others on an ultimate goal. I have greatly appreciated how much I've learned from the pair programming I've done thus far. Learning to work with each other effectively is extremely motivating and does not get enough credit in a fairly isolated industry.
