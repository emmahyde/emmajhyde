I currently work at [Constant Contact](https://www.constantcontact.com/). In 2020, I'm focused on:

- Learning AWS and supplementing my knowledge with personal projects
- Refining my Ruby/Rails expertise on a major structural refactor
- Creating in-house tooling to ease our dev team's passage and responsibility through a major refactor
- Seeking out and tackling potential slowdowns ahead of time
- Designing and implementing my own structures, from the top down
- Pushing to remove things from our monolith that do not need to be there
- Optimizing queries and working on a rake proxy between AWS and our public loadbalancer
